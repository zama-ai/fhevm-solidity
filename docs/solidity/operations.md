# Operations

The `TFHE` library defines the following operations with FHE ciphertexts:

Overloaded operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `&`, ... on encrypted integers are supported ([using for](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/contracts.html#using-for)). As of now, overloaded operators will call the versions without an overflow check.

More information about the supported operations can be found in the [function specifications](functions.md) page or in the [TFHE-rs docs](https://docs.zama.ai/tfhe-rs/getting-started/operations#arithmetic-operations.).

If you find yourself in search of a missing feature, we encourage you to [consult our roadmap](roadmap.md) for upcoming developments. Alternatively, don't hesitate to reach out to us on Discord or visit our community forum.
