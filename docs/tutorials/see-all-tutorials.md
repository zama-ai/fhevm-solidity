### Code examples in GitHub

- [ERC-20](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/examples/EncryptedERC20.sol): A variation of the standard ERC20 smart contract that incorporates encrypted balances, providing additional privacy for token holders.
- [Blind Auction](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/examples/BlindAuction.sol): A smart contract for conducting blind auctions where bids are encrypted and the winning bid remains private.

For more information on individual contracts, see the [README](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/examples/README.md) in the examples folder.

#### Legacy - Not compatible with latest fhEVM

- [Governor DAO](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/tree/main/examples/legacy/Governor): A DAO smart contract that facilitates governance decisions through encrypted voting
- [Decentralized ID](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/tree/main/examples/legacy/Identity): A blockchain-based identity management system using smart contracts to store and manage encrypted personal data.
