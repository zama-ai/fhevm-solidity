# **Start Creating Confidential Smart Contracts**

This document introduces the fundamentals of writing confidential smart contracts using the fhEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine). You'll learn how to create contracts that can perform computations on encrypted data while maintaining data privacy.

Welcome to your first steps in writing confidential Solidity smart contracts! In this guide, we'll walk through creating a basic smart contract that demonstrates core fhEVM concepts and encrypted operations.

# Your first smart contract

Letâ€™s build a simple **Encrypted Counter** smart contract to demonstrate the configuration process and the use of encrypted state variables.

### Writing the contract

Create a new file called `EncryptedCounter.sol` in your `contracts/` folder and add the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "fhevm/lib/TFHE.sol";

/// @title EncryptedCounter1
/// @notice A basic contract demonstrating the setup of encrypted types
/// @dev Uses TFHE library for fully homomorphic encryption operations
/// @custom:experimental This is a minimal example contract intended only for learning purposes
/// @custom:notice This contract has limited real-world utility and serves primarily as a starting point
/// for understanding how to implement basic FHE operations in Solidity
contract EncryptedCounter1 {
  euint8 counter;
  euint8 CONST_ONE;

  constructor() {
    TFHE.setFHEVM(FHEVMConfig.defaultConfig());

    // Initialize counter with an encrypted zero value
    counter = TFHE.asEuint8(0);
    TFHE.allowThis(counter);
    // Save on gas by computing the constant here
    CONST_ONE = TFHE.asEuint8(1);
    TFHE.allowThis(CONST_ONE);
  }

  function increment() public {
    // Perform encrypted addition to increment the counter
    counter = TFHE.add(counter, CONST_ONE);
    TFHE.allowThis(counter);
  }
}
```

### How it works

1. **Configuring fhevm**:  
   The constructor initializes the FHEVM environment with a default configuration using `TFHE.setFHEVM(FHEVMConfig.defaultConfig())`.

2. **Initializing encrypted variables**:

   - The `counter` variable is set to an encrypted `0` using `TFHE.asEuint8(0)`.
   - Permissions are granted to the contract itself for the `counter` ciphertext using `TFHE.allowThis(counter)`.
   - A constant `CONST_ONE` is initialized as an encrypted value to represent the number `1`.

3. **Encrypted operations**:  
   The `increment()` function adds the encrypted constant `CONST_ONE` to the `counter` using `TFHE.add`.

### ðŸ‘€ Can you spot a problem with this contract?

There are two notable issues with this contract:

1. **Counter Value Visibility**:  
   Since the counter is incremented by a fixed value, observers could deduce its value by analyzing blockchain events. To address this, see the documentation on:

   - [encryption and secure inputs](./inputs.md)

2. **Access Control for `counter`**:  
   The counter is encrypted, but no access is granted to decrypt or view its value. Without proper ACL permissions, the counter remains inaccessible to users. To resolve this, refer to:
   - [decryption](./decrypt.md)
   - [re-encryption](./reencryption.md)

## Your first tests

With any contracts that you write you will need to write tests as well. You can start by using something like this as a template:

```ts
import { createInstances } from "../instance";
import { getSigners, initSigners } from "../signers";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

describe("EncryptedCounter1", function () {
  before(async function () {
    await initSigners(2); // Initialize signers
    this.signers = await getSigners();
  });

  beforeEach(async function () {
    const CounterFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("EncryptedCounter1");
    this.counterContract = await CounterFactory.connect(this.signers.alice).deploy();
    await this.counterContract.waitForDeployment();
    this.contractAddress = await this.counterContract.getAddress();
    this.instances = await createInstances(this.signers); // Set up instances for testing
  });

  it("should increment the counter", async function () {
    // Perform the increment action
    const tx = await this.counterContract.increment();
    await tx.wait();
  });
});
```

### How the tests work

The test file demonstrates key concepts for testing fhEVM smart contracts:

1. **Test Setup**:

   - `before`: Initializes test signers (users) that will interact with the contract
   - `beforeEach`: Deploys a fresh instance of the contract before each test
   - Creates FHE instances for each signer to handle encryption/decryption

2. **Test Structure**:

   ```ts
   describe("Contract Name", function() {
     // Setup hooks
     before(async function() { ... })
     beforeEach(async function() { ... })

     // Individual test cases
     it("should do something", async function() { ... })
   });
   ```

3. **Key Components**:

   - `createInstances()`: Sets up FHE instances for each signer to handle encrypted operations
   - `getSigners()`: Provides test accounts to interact with the contract
   - `contractFactory.deploy()`: Creates a new contract instance for testing
   - `tx.wait()`: Ensures transactions are mined before continuing

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Deploy fresh contract instances for each test to ensure isolation
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
   - Handle asynchronous operations properly with async/await
   - Set up proper encryption instances for testing encrypted values

## **Next Steps**

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve configured and written your first confidential smart contract. Here are some ideas to expand your knowledge:

- **Explore Advanced Configurations**: Customize the `FHEVMConfig` to suit specific encryption requirements.
- **Add Functionalities**: Extend the contract by adding decrement functionality or resetting the counter.
- **Integrate Frontend**: Learn how to decrypt and display encrypted data in a dApp using the `fhevmjs` library.
