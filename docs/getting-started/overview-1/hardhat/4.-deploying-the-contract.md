# 4. Deploying the contract

This guide walks you through deploying your Confidential ERC20 smart contract on the Sepolia test network.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- A configured Hardhat project using the fhEVM Hardhat Template (see previous sections).
- A crypto wallet installed (e.g., Metamask).
- Some Sepolia ETH available for testing. If you donâ€™t have enough ETH, use a Sepolia faucet to request free SepoliaETH for testing:
  - [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)
  - [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)

## Step 1. Preparing for deployment

1. Generate a mnemonic seed for accounts using `cast`:
   - &#x20;(`cast` is a Foundry function. If you don't have Foundry installed, run `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash` first):&#x20;

```
cast wallet new-mnemonic
```

2. Obtain a Sepolia RPC URL:&#x20;
   - Sign up for a node provider such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/). Copy your Sepolia RPC URL. &#x20;
3. Open the `.env` file:
   - Past your mnemonic in the code:&#x20;
     - MNEMONIC=`<Your mnemonic generated>`
   - Paste a Sepolia RPC URL:
     - SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=`<Your node provider URL>`
4. Verify generated accounts:

```
npx hardhat get-accounts --num-accounts 5
```

## Step 2. Funding your wallet

1. Open your wallet (e.g, MetaMask)
2. Import the first 2 accounts (e.g., Alice and Bob) into your wallet with their private keys.
3. Fund these 2 accounts with some Sepolia ETH.

## Step 3. Deploying the contract

In the `deploy/` directory, there is a preconfigured `deploy.ts` file that handles the deployment process. You can customize it or add your own scripts.

To deploy the contracts to Sepolia, run:

```
# Using npm
npm run deploy-sepolia

# Using yarn
yarn deploy-sepolia

# Using pnpm
pnpm deploy-sepolia
```

## Step 4. Verify the deployment&#x20;

Once deployment is successful, you should see a console output that includes the contract address such as:&#x20;

```
MyConfidentialERC20: 0x1234........ABCD
```

You can verify this contract on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) by searching for the deployed address.
