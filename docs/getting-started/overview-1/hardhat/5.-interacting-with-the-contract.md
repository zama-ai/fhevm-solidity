# 5. Interacting with the contract

Now that you have deployed your Confidential ERC20 contract to Sepolia, let's interact with it! This section will show you how to perform basic operations with your encrypted tokens.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- Your contract deployed to Sepolia (from the previous section)
- The contract address saved
- Some Sepolia ETH in your wallet for transaction fees

## Basic Operations

You can interact with your contract using the following Hardhat tasks:

```sh
# Mint new tokens (encrypted amount)
npx hardhat mint --amount <amount> --network sepolia

# Transfer tokens to another address (encrypted amount)
npx hardhat transfer --to <recipient-address> --amount <amount> --network sepolia

# Check encrypted balance of an account
npx hardhat balance --privatekey <private-key> --network sepolia
```

## Example Workflow

Let's walk through a typical interaction sequence:

1. First, mint some tokens to your account:

```sh
npx hardhat mint --amount 1000 --network sepolia
```

2. Verify your balance:

```sh
npx hardhat balance --privatekey <your-private-key> --network sepolia
```

3. Transfer some tokens to another address:

```sh
npx hardhat transfer --to 0x... --amount 100 --network sepolia
```

## Understanding Encrypted Transactions

When interacting with your Confidential ERC20:

- All amounts are encrypted on-chain
- Only the sender and receiver can see the actual amounts
- Other users can see that transactions occurred but cannot see the amounts
- Gas fees are paid in regular (unencrypted) ETH
