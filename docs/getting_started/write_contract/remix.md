# Using Remix

This document provides guidance on using the new Zama plugin for the [the official Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org), which replaces the deprecated Remix fork. This allows you to develop and manage contracts directly in Remix by simply loading the fhEVM plugin.

## Installing the Zama plugin

1. Go to the "Plugin Manager" page
2. Click on "Connect to a Local Plugin"
3. Fill the name with "Zama" and the "Url" with "https://remix.zama.ai/"
4. Keep "Iframe" and "Side panel" and validate

## Configuring the Zama plugin

After connecting to the Zama plugin, follow the steps to configure it:

1. Click on the plugin button located on the left of the screen
2. Use the **Zama Coprocessor - Sepolia** settings or use a custom gateway and contracts settings.

Afterwards, you will be able to deploy and use any contract that you chose to compile via this plugin interface.
