# Step 4: Interacting with Your Contract

After deploying your first **fhEVM** contract using **Remix**, this guide shows you how to interact with it directly in Remix using the **Zama Plugin**.

## Prerequisite

Before interacting with your deployed contract, ensure the following:

- **Deployment completed**: You have successfully deployed the `MyConfidentialERC20` contract (see [Step 3](./deploying_cerc20.md)).
- **MetaMask wallet**: Your MetaMask wallet is connected to the Sepolia testnet(see [Step 2](./connect_wallet.md)). You have at least 2 accounts to perform token transactions.
- **Zama Plugin in Remix**: The Zama Plugin is installed and accessible in Remix (see [Step 1](./remix.md)).

## Connect the deployed contract

To perform transactions directly in Remix, your contract needs to be connected to the **Zama Plugin**:

1. In "**Deployed Contract**", copy the address of the `MYCONFIDENTIALERC20` contract that you just deployed.
2. Open the **Zama Plugin** from the side menu.
3. Paste the contract address into the **"At address"** field under the **Deploy** section.
4. Click **At address**.

## Verify the connection

If the address was entered correctly, the `MyConfidentialERC20.sol` contract will be displayed in the "**Deployed Contract**" inside the **Zama Plugin**.

Click the contract to expand, you will see all the features that you can interact with.

`ConfidentialERC20Mintable` supports all standard ERC-20 functions, but adapted for encrypted values, including:

- `transfer`: Securely transfers encrypted tokens.
- `approve`: Approves encrypted amounts for spending.
- `transferFrom`: Transfers tokens on behalf of another address.
- `balanceOf`: Returns the encrypted balance of an account.
- `totalSupply`: Returns the total token supply.

## Mint tokens to your account

From here, you can mint confidential ERC20 token to your account:

1. Click to expand the **mint** function.
2. Enter your wallet address.
3. Specify the amount of tokens to mint (e.g., `10000`).
4. Click `Submit`.
5. Confirm the transaction in **MetaMask**.

## Verify total supply

After a successful mint transaction, click the **totalSupply** to reflect the minted tokens (e.g., `10000`).

## 5. Check your balance

To verify your account balance:

1. Click to expand the **balanceOf** function.
2. Enter your wallet address.
3. Click `Submit` to verify your account balance.

Your balance is stored as encrypted data using FHE. No one else can view if except you.

To view the balance in plaintext:

- Click the **re-encrypt** option
- Confirm the transaction in Metamask

You can see that the ciphertext is decrypted and your balance is the amount that you just minted.

## 6. Transfer tokens

To transfer confidential ERC20 tokens to another account:

1. Click **transfer** to expand the function, set the following parameters:

   - **To**: Enter the wallet address of the recipient.
   - **encryptedAmount**: Specify the amount that you want to transfer (e.g.`1000`). Choose `euint64`.
   - **inputProof**: Check the **input** box.

2. Click **Submit** to proceed.
3. Confirm the transaction in **MetaMask**.

## 7. Verify updated balance

After making a transfer, you can verify your updated account balance:

1. Use the **balanceOf** function again to check your updated balance (see the [Step 5: Check your balance](#5-check-your-balance).)
2. Perform **re-encryption** to confirm the changes, you should see the remaining token in your account.(e.g., `9000` tokens remaining).

![Verify updated balance](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2025-01-17/41be5952-5036-41ed-b0c6-be78b3490275/stack_animation.webp)
