# Quick start tutorial: Build your first FHE smart contract

Welcome to the world of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** and privacy-preserving smart contracts! This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through deploying your first **confidential smart contract** using Zamaâ€™s groundbreaking FHE technology.

## What you'll build

### Encrypted balances

ConfidentialERC20 revolutionizes the way balances are stored by encrypting them using FHE.

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Balances are stored as encrypted values (`euint64`), ensuring no one can view account balances by inspecting the blockchain.
- **Exclusive Access**: Only the account owner can decrypt and view their own balance.
- **Encrypted Transactions**: Transaction amounts are also encrypted, maintaining confidentiality.

### Standard ERC20 functions with encryption

ConfidentialERC20 supports all the standard ERC20 functions, adapted for encrypted values. For example:

- `transfer`: Securely transfers encrypted tokens.
- `approve`: Approves encrypted amounts for spending.
- `transferFrom`: Transfers tokens on behalf of another address.
- `balanceOf`: Returns the encrypted balance of an account.
- `totalSupply`: Returns the encrypted total token supply.

## What is `ConfidentialERC20Mintable`?

The **`ConfidentialERC20Mintable`** contract, part of the **`fhevm-contracts`** library, extends the ConfidentialERC20 by adding **minting capabilities**.

### **Key Features**

- **All ConfidentialERC20 functions**: Since the `ConfidentialERC20Mintable` is extending the `ConfidentialERC20` contract, it has all the functionalities that the `ConfidentialERC20` contract has.
- **Minting**: The contract owner can securely create new tokens and distribute them.

## What you'll achieve

In just **~20 minutes**, youâ€™ll:

1. [**Set up Remix**](getting_started/quick_start/remix.md) â€“ Configure your development environment to support FHE contracts.
2. [**Connect Your Wallet**](getting_started/quick_start/connect_wallet.md) â€“ Prepare for deployment by linking your crypto wallet.
3. [**Deploy ConfidentialERC20**](getting_started/quick_start/first_smart_contract.md) â€“ Launch your first FHE-enabled token on the blockchain.
4. [**Interact with Your Contract**](getting_started/quick_start/deploy.md) â€“ Use your deployed contract to mint, transfer, and manage confidential tokens.
5. _(Optional)_ [**Understand ConfidentialERC20**](getting_started/quick_start/understandingERC20.md) â€“ Dive deeper into the contract's privacy-focused functionality.

### Why FHE smart contracts?

**FHE** enables computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. With Zamaâ€™s **fhEVM**, developers can create privacy-first decentralized applications while preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data.
