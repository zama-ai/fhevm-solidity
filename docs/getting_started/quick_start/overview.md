# Quick start tutorial: Build your first FHE smart contract

Welcome to the world of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** and privacy-preserving smart contracts! This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through deploying your first **confidential smart contract** using Zamaâ€™s groundbreaking FHE technology.

## What you'll build

You will build a `ConfidentialERC20Mintable` token - a privacy-preserving ERC20 implementation that uses FHE to keep balances and transactions confidential. This token contract allows minting new tokens and includes all standard confidential ERC20 functionality while maintaining complete privacy of user data.

### Encrypted balances

The `ConfidentialERC20Mintable` token extends the standard `ConfidentialERC20` contract by adding secure minting capabilities. The base `ConfidentialERC20` contract revolutionizes token privacy by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to store all balances in an encrypted format. This means that while transactions and balances are recorded on the public blockchain, their actual values remain completely confidential and can only be accessed by authorized parties.

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Balances are stored as encrypted values (`euint64`), ensuring no one can view account balances by inspecting the blockchain.
- **Exclusive Access**: Only the account owner can decrypt and view their own balance.
- **Encrypted Transactions**: Transaction amounts are also encrypted, maintaining confidentiality.

### Standard ERC20 functions with encryption

ConfidentialERC20 supports all the standard ERC20 functions, adapted for encrypted values. For example:

- `transfer`: Securely transfers encrypted tokens.
- `approve`: Approves encrypted amounts for spending.
- `transferFrom`: Transfers tokens on behalf of another address.
- `balanceOf`: Returns the encrypted balance of an account.
- `totalSupply`: Returns the total token supply.
