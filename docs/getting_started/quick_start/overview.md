# Quick start tutorial: Build your first FHE smart contract

Welcome to the world of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** and privacy-preserving smart contracts! This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through deploying your first **confidential smart contract** using Zamaâ€™s groundbreaking FHE technology.

### What you'll achieve

In just **~20 minutes**, youâ€™ll:

1. [**Set up Remix**](getting_started/quick_start/remix.md) â€“ Configure your development environment to support FHE contracts.
2. [**Connect Your Wallet**](getting_started/quick_start/connect_wallet.md) â€“ Prepare for deployment by linking your crypto wallet.
3. [**Deploy ConfidentialERC20**](getting_started/quick_start/first_smart_contract.md) â€“ Launch your first FHE-enabled token on the blockchain.
4. [**Interact with Your Contract**](getting_started/quick_start/deploy.md) â€“ Use your deployed contract to mint, transfer, and manage confidential tokens.
5. _(Optional)_ [**Understand ConfidentialERC20**](getting_started/quick_start/understandingERC20.md) â€“ Dive deeper into the contract's privacy-focused functionality.

### Why FHE smart contracts?

**FHE** enables computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. With Zamaâ€™s **fhEVM**, developers can create privacy-first decentralized applications while preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data.
