# Understanding ConfidentialERC20

The **ConfidentialERC20** contract is a privacy-preserving implementation of the ERC20 token standard, leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. It combines the familiar functionality of ERC20 tokens with powerful encryption features to protect user privacy.

## What are `fhevm-contracts`?

The `fhevm-contracts` library is a collection of **privacy-preserving smart contracts** built specifically for the **fhEVM** (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine). It provides:

- **Ready-to-use confidential contracts**: Pre-built implementations of common token standards with FHE capabilities
- **Base contracts**: Foundational building blocks for creating custom confidential smart contracts
- **Extensions**: Additional features and utilities that can be added to base contracts
- **Testing utilities**: Tools to help test FHE-enabled smart contracts

The library serves as both a reference implementation and a toolkit for developers building privacy-focused applications on the fhEVM. It demonstrates best practices for implementing confidential operations while maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum standards.

To learn more about the `fhevm-contracts` and how to use them refer to the [fhevm-contracts page](../../smart_contracts/contracts.md).
