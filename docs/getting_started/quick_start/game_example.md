### **Encrypted "Secret Keeper" Game**

#### Concept:

A decentralized "Secret Keeper" game where players submit secrets in encrypted form. The smart contract evaluates certain conditions (e.g., whether a secret satisfies a rule or threshold) and decides whether to reveal, re-encrypt, or store the secret for future processing.

#### **Project Details:**

1. **Players Submit Encrypted Secrets:**

   - Each player submits their secret as an encrypted input using the public FHE key.
   - Secrets can be text-based or numerical (e.g., a number representing "luck points").

2. **Decryption and Validation:**

   - The contract decrypts the input using the Gateway to verify the secret against specific criteria.
     - Example: A secret number must be divisible by 3 or must fall within a range like `[50, 100]`.

3. **Re-encryption for Challenges:**

   - Valid secrets are re-encrypted with new permissions, allowing only the contract or specific users to use them.
   - For example, re-encrypt a numerical secret for comparison in a multiplayer mini-game.

4. **TFHE.select for Decision-Making:**

   - The game logic uses `TFHE.select` to decide outcomes based on secret attributes.
     - Example:
       - If a player's secret is greater than another player's, they win the round.
       - If neither meets the conditions, a fallback encrypted value (e.g., 0) is chosen.

5. **Encrypted Mini-Games:**

   - Example: "Closest to the Target"
     - The contract stores an encrypted target value.
     - Players submit encrypted guesses, and the contract compares guesses using TFHE operations to determine the winner without revealing the actual target or guesses.

6. **Reveal Phase:**
   - At the end of the game, the winning secret (or guess) is decrypted and revealed publicly, ensuring transparency.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Decryption**: Used for validating secrets.
- **Re-encryption**: Ensures secrets can be reused securely in mini-games.
- **TFHE.select**: Implements game logic for comparisons and decision-making.
- **Encrypted Inputs**: Players interact with the contract securely, ensuring no data is exposed prematurely.
