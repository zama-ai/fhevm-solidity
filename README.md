## About

### What is fhEVM

**fhEVM** is a technology that enables confidential smart contracts on the EVM using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).

Thanks to a breakthrough in homomorphic encryption, Zama’s fhEVM makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on encrypted data, guaranteeing both confidentiality and composability with:

- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dapps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn't impact existing dapps.
  <br></br>

### Main features

- **Solidity integration:** fhEVM contracts are simple solidity contracts that are built using traditional solidity toolchains.
- **Simple developer experience:** Developers can use the `euint` data types to mark which part of their contracts should be private.
- **Programmable privacy:** All the logic for access control of encrypted states is defined by developers in their smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers
- **Full range of operators :** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `==`, …
- **Encrypted if-else conditionals :** Check conditions on encrypted states
- **On-chain PRNG :** Generate secure randomness without using oracles
- **Configurable decryption :** Threshold, centralized or KMS decryption
- **Unbounded compute Depth :** Unlimited consecutive FHE operations

_Learn more about fhEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm)._

### Use cases

fhEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without learning cryptography. Leveraging fhEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFI, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.
- **Private transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause-Clear

pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "fhevm/lib/TFHE.sol";
import "fhevm/config/ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol";

contract Counter is SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig {
  euint8 internal counter;

  constructor() {
    counter = TFHE.asEuint8(0);
    TFHE.allowThis(counter);
  }

  function add(einput valueInput, bytes calldata inputProof) public {
    euint8 value = TFHE.asEuint8(valueInput, inputProof);
    counter = TFHE.add(counter, value);
    TFHE.allowThis(counter);
  }
}

## Blockchain Implementation

To integrate fhevm-go into any EVM-based blockchain, you can follow the [Integration Guide](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm-go/getting_started/integration).

## Working with fhEVM

### Developer Guide

Install dependencies (Solidity libraries and dev tools)

```bash
npm install
```

> [!Note]
> Solidity files are formatted with prettier.

#### Generate TFHE lib

```
npm run codegen
```

> [!Warning]
> Use this command to generate Solidity code and prettier result automatically!

Files that are generated now (can be seen inside `codegen/main.ts`)

```
lib/Impl.sol
lib/TFHE.sol
contracts/tests/TFHETestSuiteX.sol
test/tfheOperations/tfheOperations.ts
```

<p align="right">
  <a href="#about" > ↑ Back to top </a>
</p>

#### Adding new operators

Operators can be defined as data inside `codegen/common.ts` file and code automatically generates solidity overloads.
Test for overloads must be added (or the build doesn't pass) inside `codegen/overloadsTests.ts` file.
